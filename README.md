# Machine Learning: Decision Tree
In this project me and my partner implemented the decision tree algorithm used for classification problems.
We are using the numpy, pandas and matplot libraries to do so.
Note that some cells may take up to 10 minutes to run: that's meant to be.
The data given is on mushrooms and whether they are edible or poisnous.
Enjoy!
